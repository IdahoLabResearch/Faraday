# Faraday

Faraday is a high-temperature electrolysis data visualizer with applications in button cell research.

This full-stack application establishes connections to the INL DeepLynx data warehouse, and reads button cell data into charts on a user interface.

Further, Faraday transmits button-cell data to a server application where electrochemical impedance spectroscopy libraries return analyses on distribution relaxation times, sigmoid regressions, and others under development.

Faraday users can compare two button cells by adding them to a comparison module, and generating reports to visualize their performance side-by-side.
